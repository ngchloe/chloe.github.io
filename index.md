This is a Metric calculator for the International Building Code.
It covers Occupant Load (chap 10) and Plumbing Fixtures (chap 29).

I made this calculator because I was tired of looking at only Imperial-based calculators online (SI units, anybody??)

Development time: 1 month because I'm a noob - just see the hacky JS and that should be plainly obvious.
